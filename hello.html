  <h1>Welcome to my website!!!</h1>

                <h2>Hello!</h2>
  <p>Hello, world!</p>

<p>I have deleted all of the previous test paragraphs in this project to get a better sense of coding and using Github.  I am learning the programming commands and the C program currently as well as the git system.  Although I am making changes on an amateur level, I am leaving this project public.  Today I am going to experiment with adding css to my webpage with a stylesheet and maybe adding other features I have learned like ordered lists, forms, etc.</p>
